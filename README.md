# GoodHealth
This project aims to enhance healthcare operations at GoodHealth, a Colorado-based hospital, by using Business Intelligence (BI) tools and machine learning algorithms to optimize the Length of Stay (LOS) for patients. The primary goal is to improve patient outcomes, streamline resource allocation, and increase operational efficiency by leveraging real-time data from patient EMRs, disease registries, and the OECD database.

Key Features
Accurate LOS Prediction: Machine learning models predict the Length of Stay for patients, with improved accuracy of up to 40%.
Data Integration: Combines data from multiple sources, including Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), the OECD database, and vital sign records, to feed into predictive models.
BI Tools: Utilizes Power BI and Tableau for real-time visualization of patient data, aiding in decision-making and resource management.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements advanced algorithms like random forests and ensemble decision trees for LOS prediction.
Operational Efficiency: Helps optimize resource allocation (beds, staff, equipment) based on predictive LOS estimates, improving hospital throughput.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python, SQL
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau
Database: SQL-based warehouse, OECD data repository
Data Sources: Patient EMRs, OECD database, disease registries

The Business Intelligence solution provided by this project allows the hospital management to:

Improve the accuracy of LOS predictions by 40%.
Enhance patient outcomes and reduce the risk of readmissions.
Optimize bed allocation and resource management, increasing hospital throughput.
Provide data-driven insights into patient care and operational efficiency.
